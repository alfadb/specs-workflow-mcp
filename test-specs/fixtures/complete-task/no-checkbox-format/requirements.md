# Test Feature - Requirements Document

## Core Features

The Test Feature provides essential functionality for testing the specs-mcp workflow system. It enables comprehensive validation of all workflow states and transitions.

## User Stories

- As a developer, I want to test the workflow, so that I can ensure it works correctly
- As a tester, I want to verify all states, so that I can catch edge cases
- As a maintainer, I want automated tests, so that I can prevent regressions

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The system must handle all workflow states (init, check, skip, confirm, complete_task)
- [ ] Error handling must be comprehensive and provide clear error messages
- [ ] Performance must meet benchmarks (< 2s response time)
- [ ] Security requirements must be met (input validation, no code injection)
- [ ] All operations must be idempotent where applicable

## Non-functional Requirements

- Performance: Response time < 2s for all operations
- Security: All inputs validated, no arbitrary code execution
- Compatibility: Works on macOS and Linux
- Reliability: 100% test coverage required
- Maintainability: Clear error messages and logging
