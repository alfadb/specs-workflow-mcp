- [X] 6.3 Uppercase X completion
- [ ] 6.4 Another pending task

### 7. Long Description Task
- [ ] 7.1 This is a very long task description that spans multiple concepts and ideas, including technical implementation details, user requirements, business logic, error handling, performance considerations, and documentation requirements
- [ ] 7.2 Short task

- [ ] 10.2 Task with just spaces    
- [ ]
- [ ] 10.3 Normal task after empty ones

### 11. Duplicate Numbers

### 14. Multiple Dots in Numbers
- [ ] 14.1.1.1 Four-level deep task
- [ ] 14.1.1.2 Another four-level
- [ ] 14.1.2 Back to three levels
- [ ] 14.2 Two levels

## Non-Task Content

This paragraph should be ignored by the parser as it doesn't contain checkboxes.

### 20. Header Without Tasks

This section has a header but no actual tasks below it.

### 21. Mixed Content
- [ ] 21.1 Valid task
- Regular bullet point without checkbox
- Another bullet point
- [ ] 21.2 Another valid task

### 22. Tasks with Descriptions on Next Line
- [ ] 22.1
  Detailed description on the next line
- [ ] 22.2
  Another task with description below

### 23. Final Complex Test Group
- [x] 23.1 Completed task with complex **formatting** and `code blocks`
- [ ] 23.2 Pending task referencing issue #123 and PR !456
- [ ] 23.3 Task with URL: https://example.com/api/v1/endpoint
- [ ] 23.4 Task with file path: /path/to/important/file.ts
- [ ] 23.5 Last task in the edge cases test suite
