# Edge Cases Testing - Requirements Document

## Project Overview

This is a comprehensive test project designed to validate the robustness of the task parsing system under various edge conditions and irregular formats.

## User Stories

### 1. Task Parser Robustness
**As a** developer using the specs-mcp system  
**I want** the task parser to handle various formatting irregularities gracefully  
**So that** real-world task documents with inconsistent formatting still work correctly  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** tasks have irregular spacing, **THEN** the parser should still identify them correctly
2. **WHEN** tasks use mixed checkbox styles (x, X, space), **THEN** all should be recognized
3. **WHEN** tasks have multi-level hierarchies, **THEN** the parser should build correct parent-child relationships
4. **WHEN** tasks have duplicate numbers, **THEN** the parser should handle them gracefully without errors
5. **WHEN** subtasks exist without main tasks, **THEN** virtual parent tasks should be created automatically

### 2. Complex Hierarchy Support
**As a** project manager  
**I want** to create deeply nested task structures  
**So that** I can organize complex projects with multiple levels of sub-tasks  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** creating 4-level deep tasks (1.1.1.1), **THEN** the parser should handle them correctly
2. **WHEN** mixing different hierarchy levels, **THEN** the structure should be preserved
3. **WHEN** completing nested tasks, **THEN** parent task status should update appropriately

### 3. Edge Case Handling
**As a** system administrator  
**I want** the parser to handle malformed or edge case inputs  
**So that** the system remains stable even with problematic input data  

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **WHEN** encountering empty task descriptions, **THEN** the parser should skip them gracefully
2. **WHEN** finding orphaned subtasks, **THEN** virtual parent tasks should be created
3. **WHEN** processing mixed content (tasks and non-tasks), **THEN** only valid tasks should be parsed
4. **WHEN** handling special characters and formatting, **THEN** the core task information should be preserved

## Technical Requirements

- Parser must be language-agnostic (work with any text content)
- Must support checkbox patterns: [ ], [x], [X]
- Must support hierarchical numbering: 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.1.1
- Must handle irregular whitespace and formatting
- Must create virtual parent tasks for orphaned subtasks
- Must maintain task completion statistics accurately
