6. **`scripts/setup-remote.sh`** - Automated remote environment setup script
7. **`scripts/test-remote.js`** - Test script for remote features
8. **`REMOTE-DEVELOPMENT.md`** - Complete remote development guide

### Modified Files

1. **`src/index.ts`** - Added remote environment detection and logging
2. **`src/features/executeWorkflow.ts`** - Integrated remote path resolution
3. **`package.json`** - Added remote development scripts
4. **`README.md`** - Updated with remote development information

## üîß Key Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Detection

```typescript
// Automatically detects VS Code Remote SSH environment
const remoteInfo = detectRemoteEnvironment();
if (remoteInfo.isRemote) {
  console.log(
    `üåê Running in remote environment: ${remoteInfo.remoteUser}@${remoteInfo.remoteHost}`
  );
}
```

**Detection Capabilities:**

- SSH connection detection via environment variables
- VS Code Remote SSH session identification
- Remote container support
- Workspace folder mapping

### 2. Path Resolution

```typescript
// Resolves paths correctly in both local and remote environments
const resolvedPath = resolveRemotePath("./my-project");
```

**Path Handling Features:**

- Automatic remote path resolution
- Cross-platform path normalization
- Workspace-relative path calculation
- Home directory detection

### 3. VS Code Integration

**Debug Configurations:**

- Debug compiled JavaScript with source maps
- Debug TypeScript directly with tsx
- MCP Inspector integration

**Tasks:**

- Build and watch tasks with problem matchers
- Remote-specific setup and testing tasks
- Background process support

**Settings:**

- Remote SSH platform detection
- Optimized file watching and exclusions
- Terminal configuration for Linux environments

### 4. Development Tools

**Setup Script (`setup-remote.sh`):**

```bash
./scripts/setup-remote.sh
```

- Automatic dependency installation
- Environment detection and logging
- Configuration file generation
- Build testing and validation

**Testing Script (`test-remote.js`):**

```bash
./scripts/test-remote.js
```

- Environment detection testing
- Path resolution validation
- Feature functionality verification

## üåê Remote Environment Support

### Supported Environments

- **VS Code Remote SSH**: Full support with automatic detection
- **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**: Compatible with Windows development
- **Remote Containers**: Docker-based development environments
- **SSH Tunneling**: Direct SSH connections with VS Code

### Environment Variables Detected

- `VSCODE_REMOTE_NAME`: VS Code remote session identifier
- `SSH_CONNECTION`: SSH connection details
- `SSH_CLIENT`: SSH client information
- `REMOTE_CONTAINERS`: Container environment indicator
- `VSCODE_WORKSPACE_FOLDER`: Remote workspace path

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain full backward compatibility:

- **Local Development**: Works exactly as before
- **Existing APIs**: No breaking changes to MCP interfaces
- **Configuration**: Optional remote features don't affect local usage
- **Dependencies**: No additional runtime dependencies

## üìä Performance Optimizations

### File Watching Exclusions

```json
{
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true,
    "**/.git/**": true
  }
}
```

### Terminal Optimization

- Pre-configured shell preferences
- Optimized login shell initialization
- Platform-specific terminal profiles

### Build Process

- Incremental TypeScript compilation
- Source map generation for debugging
- Automatic permission setting for executables

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

### Remote Development Workflow

1. **Setup:**

   ```bash
   # Connect via VS Code Remote SSH
   # Clone/open project in remote VS Code
   ./scripts/setup-remote.sh
   ```

2. **Development:**

   ```bash
   # Use VS Code tasks or direct commands
   npm run watch    # Background compilation
   npm run dev      # Development server
   ```

3. **Debugging:**
   - Press `F5` to start debugging
   - Use integrated terminal for testing
   - View logs in remote environment

### MCP Server Testing

```bash
# Test server functionality
npm run build
node dist/index.js --version

# Test with MCP Inspector
npm run inspector

# Validate remote features
npm run remote:info
./scripts/test-remote.js
```

## üîç Troubleshooting Features

### Debug Logging

```typescript
// Automatic debug output in development mode
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  logRemoteEnvironment();
}
```

### Configuration Validation

```bash
# Check remote configuration
cat .remote/config.json

# Validate environment
npm run remote:info
```

### Path Resolution Testing

```typescript
// Test path resolution in different contexts
const pathResolver = createRemotePathResolver();
console.log(pathResolver.resolve("./project-path"));
```

## üìà Benefits

1. **Seamless Remote Development**: Work on remote servers as if local
2. **Consistent Environment**: Same tools and configuration everywhere
3. **Performance**: Optimized for remote development workflows
4. **Debugging**: Full debugging support in remote environments
5. **Automation**: One-command setup and configuration
6. **Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows hosts

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **For Remote Development:**

   ```bash
   # In VS Code with Remote SSH connected
   git clone <repository>
   cd specs-workflow-mcp
   ./scripts/setup-remote.sh
   ```

2. **For Local Development:**
   ```bash
   # Nothing changes - works as before
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## üìö Documentation

- **Complete Guide**: See `REMOTE-DEVELOPMENT.md`
- **Configuration**: Check `.vscode/` directory
- **Examples**: Review `scripts/test-remote.js`
- **Troubleshooting**: Consult debug output and logs

This implementation provides enterprise-grade remote development support while maintaining the simplicity and reliability of the original MCP server architecture.
