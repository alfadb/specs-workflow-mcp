## Why Use It?

### ‚ùå Without Spec Workflow

- AI jumps randomly between tasks, lacking systematic approach
- Requirements disconnect from actual code implementation
- Scattered documentation, difficult to track project progress
- Missing design decision records

### ‚úÖ With Spec Workflow

- AI completes tasks sequentially, maintaining focus and context
- Complete traceability from user stories to code implementation
- Standardized document templates with automatic progress management
- Each stage requires confirmation, ensuring correct direction
- **Persistent progress**: Continue from where you left off with `check`, even in new conversations

## Quick Start

### 1. Install (Claude Code Example)

```bash
claude mcp add spec-workflow-mcp -s user -- npx -y spec-workflow-mcp@latest
```

See [full installation guide](#installation-guide) for other clients.

### 2. Start a New Project

```
"Help me create a user authentication system using spec workflow"
```

### 3. Continue Existing Project

```
"Use spec workflow check ./my-project"
```

AI will automatically detect project status and continue from where you left off.

## Workflow Example

### 1. You Describe Requirements

```
You: "I need to build a user authentication system"
```

### 2. AI Creates Structured Documents

```
AI: "I'll help you create a spec workflow for user authentication..."

üìù requirements.md - User stories and feature requirements
üé® design.md - Technical architecture and design decisions
‚úÖ tasks.md - Concrete implementation task list
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Review and Implementation

After each phase completion, AI will request your confirmation before proceeding to ensure the project stays on the right track.

## Document Organization

### Basic Structure

```
my-project/specs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md              # Requirements: User stories, feature specs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ design.md                    # Design: Architecture, APIs, data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tasks.md                     # Tasks: Numbered implementation steps
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .workflow-confirmations.json # Status: Automatic progress tracking
```

### Multi-Module Projects

```
my-project/specs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-authentication/         # Authentication module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payment-system/             # Payment module
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notification-service/       # Notification module
```

You can specify any directory: `"Create auth docs using spec workflow in ./src/features/auth"`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spec-workflow": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "spec-workflow-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Cursor

## ü§ñ AI Usage Guidelines

### To Help AI Use This Tool Better

**Strongly recommended** to add the following prompt to your AI assistant configuration. Without this configuration, AI might:

- ‚ùå Not know when to invoke Spec Workflow
- ‚ùå Forget to manage task progress, leading to chaotic work
- ‚ùå Not use Spec Workflow for systematic document management
- ‚ùå Unable to continuously track project status

With this configuration, AI will intelligently use Spec Workflow to manage the entire development process.

> **Configuration Note**: Please modify the following as needed:
>
> 1. Change `./specs` to your preferred document directory path
> 2. Change "English" to your preferred document language (like "Chinese")

```
# Spec Workflow Usage Guidelines

## 1. Check Project Progress
When users mention continuing previous projects or are unsure of current progress, proactively use:
specs-workflow tool with action.type="check" and path="./specs"

## 2. Document Language
All spec workflow documents should be written consistently in English, including all content in requirements, design, and task documents.

## 3. Document Directory
All spec workflow documents should be placed in the ./specs directory to maintain consistent project document organization.

## 4. Task Management
Always use the following to manage task progress:
specs-workflow tool with action.type="complete_task" and taskNumber="current task number"
Follow the workflow guidance to continue working until all tasks are completed.

## 5. Best Practices
- Proactive progress check: When user says "continue from last time", first use check to see current status
- Language consistency: Use the same language throughout all project documents
- Flexible structure: Choose single-module or multi-module organization based on project scale
- Task granularity: Each task should be completable within 1-2 hours
```
